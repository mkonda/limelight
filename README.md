# Limelight

Inspired by a club I used to go to back in the good old days,
this tool is a quick interface to Clubhouse.

In particular, I want to be able to use Clubhouse UI for 
high level planning but I want to be able to use a CLI
that let's me stay plugged in and focus on getting things
done like todo.sh.

## Set Up

You need to get the program either from releases or using go get.

You need to get an API key from Clubhouse.

You can then specify that with `--clubhouse-token xyz` at the command line,
or put it in your `~/.limelight.yaml` file.  See `limelight.yaml.example` in
the project root for the format.

## Running

Running simple search on stories.

`go run limelight.go clubhouse stories`

You can also supply a query in `--stories-query`.  If it works here: 
`https://app.clubhouse.io/<your-org>/search` it should work with limelight.

Some examples:

* `--stories-query "state:500000027 -is:archived"` Kanban state open and not archved
* `--stories-query "due:2021-01-01..2021-02-05 owner:mattkonda -is:archived"` Owned by Matt, not archived, due in a date range.
* `go run limelight.go clubhouse stories --stories-query "due:2021-01-01..2021-02-05 owner:mattkonda -is:archived label:PriorityA"` with label!

## Knowing Your States

Some of the specific states can be really handy to manipulate by hand.  But we need to know the ids for this.

`limelight clubhouse states`

```
mkonda@jazz limelight % go run limelight.go clubhouse states                                                                           

Workflow: Feature Requests
Workflow State:         Name: Backlog   ID: 500000016
Workflow State:         Name: To be Prioritized ID: 500000015
Workflow State:         Name: Low Impact        ID: 500000014
Workflow State:         Name: High Impact       ID: 500000013
Workflow State:         Name: Out of Scope      ID: 500000017

Workflow: Engineering
Workflow State:         Name: Unscheduled       ID: 500000008
Workflow State:         Name: Ready for Development     ID: 500000007
Workflow State:         Name: In Development    ID: 500000006
Workflow State:         Name: Ready for Review  ID: 500000010
Workflow State:         Name: Ready for Deploy  ID: 500000009
Workflow State:         Name: Completed ID: 500000011

Workflow: Simple Kanban
Workflow State:         Name: Unstarted ID: 500000027
Workflow State:         Name: Started   ID: 500000026
Workflow State:         Name: Done      ID: 500000028

Workflow: Consulting
Workflow State:         Name: Unstarted ID: 500000252
Workflow State:         Name: Started   ID: 500000251
Workflow State:         Name: Done      ID: 500000253
```

## Updating Stories

The following illustrate the two ways that we can currently update stories.

* `go run limelight.go clubhouse story 1316 --story-label PriorityA` - Add a label to an existing story.
* `go run limelight.go clubhouse story 885 --story-state 500000028` - Change a story stage.

For now, this is enough to get me to GTDâ„¢ from the CLI with Clubhouse as the back end.
